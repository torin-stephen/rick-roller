# Rick Roller

A chrome extension to always forward youtube watch urls to Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up. It is very simple, and only a single line of code (Excluding manifest).

## Installation

Using the [Chrome Extension Manager](chrome://extensions) turn on developer mode

Click on **Load Unpacked** and select your folder containing the files. The folder should contain a **manifest.json** and two sub-directories. Choose that one.

## Usage

Whenever you visit a page with "youtube.com/watch" or "youtube.co.uk/watch" it will forward to "youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" which will start playing the song.
